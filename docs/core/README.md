# How It Works

At its core, **Codotype** is just fancy machinery that makes it easier to create files and directories programatically.

but its structure, opinions, and surounding tools make it much more powerful

The contents of the resulting files and the structure of their surrounding directories is entirely open to configuration - it's not just a tool for any one programming language.
