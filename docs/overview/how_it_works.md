# How It Works

At its core, **Codotype** is just fancy machinery that makes it easier to create files and directories programatically.

<!-- but its structure, opinions, and surounding tools make it much more powerful -->

<!-- The contents of the resulting files and the structure of their surrounding directories is entirely open to configuration - it's not just a tool for any one programming language. -->

**TODO** - document + diagram architecture here, including:

- high-level interplay beween core machinery & abstractions
- separation of concerns between generator, runtime, cli, ui
