# Codotype Generators

This is where we document the ins-and-outs of codotype generators.


## Metadata
Each codotype generator requires the following metadata
- `id`
- `name`
- `icon_url`
- `github_url`

## Global Options
A generator may optionally expose a series of global options that an end-user may configure when they run the generator.

## Model Options
A generator may optionally expose a series of configurable fields whose values are scoped to each model in the generated app.

## Addons Options
A generator may optionally expose a series of configurable Addons that facilitate additional functionality in a generator.
